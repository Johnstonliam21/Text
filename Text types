<p> 2016 Olympics were amazing for Andre de Grasse winning three medals in three events. Never able to win gold because Usain Bolt was in the way. Next summer olympics, Usain Bolt being retired will be a big year for Andre de Grass to show if he can dominate like Usain did. Usain winning 9 gold medals in only 9 events!!!  </p>
